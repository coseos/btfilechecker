A file checker for bt/list files - this is a tool for a tool you will probably never see in the wild

## Usage

Run btfilechecker with a prefix that specifies the location of your bt files and a file that lists all bt files

The list from the file is processed one by one to verify that the files listed exis in the location you specified as the first parameter

## Description

I came across this file type in a project and i wanted to verify my bt files are valid so i wrote this tool in GO.

This is "i don't care" work. It works for me. You can copy and use it but there is no support. This tool is intende for private usage.
